# Gearoenix game engine
An experimental game engine.
My plan is to support OpenGL(ES2/ES3), Vulkan, and maybe Metal and
Directx12 in future.

You can do whatever you want to do as long as you take responsibility of all of
its consequences, **But** If you used it and it was useful for you, please make
an acknowledgment and promotion for this project and me, I'm really need that
because I'm currently seeking for a job in the graphic and game-engine fields.
