In progress...

## Materials

- All elements in uniform structures of materials must be alphabetically sorted.
- All material must have a padded uniform structure.
- Most of the opaque shaders are capable of being used as transparent too, so
  be careful when you are writing materials and shaders.

## Shaders

- Most of the opaque shaders are capable of being used as transparent too, so
  be careful when you are writing materials and shaders.
